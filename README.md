This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

- Have Angular 13.3.3 or later.
- Have NODE ready.

  Run `npm install`. If it doesn't work try `npm install --force`

## Build(if needed)

  Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
